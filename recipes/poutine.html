    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Poutine, which was invented in Quebec in the 1950s, is a Canadian dish composed of fries topped with cheese curds and hot gravy. "Poutine" is a Quebecois slang word that means "mess."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: You'll need a quart of vegetable oil for frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravy</strong>: Use a store-bought can of beef gravy or make your own at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Fries</strong>: Russet potatoes work well for French fries, as they're extra starchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese curds</strong>: Cheese curds are key for authentic poutine. However, if you like, you can use shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
